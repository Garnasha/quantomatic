==  INSTALLATION FOR FIREFOX  ==
================================

Ensure that the quantomatic core heap (../core/heaps/quanto.polyml-heap) is
built, then build the polychrome heap with:

# cd chromeui
# make

Once the heap is built, replace polychrome's default heap with the symlink to
the QuantoCosy heap.

# cd $FIREFOX_SUPPORT_DIR/Profiles/XXXXXXX.default/extensions/polychrome@ed.ac.uk/poly/bin
# cp polychrome.polyml-heap polychrome.polyml-heap-bak
# ln -s $QUANTO_DIR/cosy/chromeui/polychrome.polyml-heap polychrome.polyml-heap


Once that's done, open chromeui/cosy.html in Firefox and synthesise away. All
interaction is from the ML prompt. Check cosy_ghzw.sml for useful functions
and guidance for implementing other theories.
