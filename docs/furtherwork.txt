Some imidiate priorities 
---

1. getting the node expressions working in GUI -- it's possible here
we could use some of the new stuff that Aleks has added with maxima.

2. !-box graphs and graph matching. 

3. Reading XML at the ML level. 



Some ideas for future directions for the tool
---

* LaTeX output.  Movies of rewrite sequences?

* more graph variants:  polycats; measurement calculus; generalised
MUB classical objects with more than 2 incompatible bases

* Strategies and Tactics:  user defined rewriting strategies; perhaps
making use of the external programs or oracles (c.f. Flow/Gflow
algorithms)

* Automatic proofs of equivalence of programs

* Semantics -- compute the semantics of a diagram; integration with
matlab?  Use an internal complex arithmetic package to compute?
There are issues here regarding 1) scalar factors and 2) equalities
which are correct quantum mechanically but not true at the  matrix
level.

* Meta level:  termination/confluence etc.  Make the rewrite system
well behaved.  how good can it be?

* ?extend to multiplicative-additive case?
