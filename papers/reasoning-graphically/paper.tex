\begin{abstract}
  Systems of quantum computation are typically represented by large
  matrix compositions. However, recent graph-based formalisms offer an
  approach which exposes the structure of these systems in a clearer
  and more accessible way. Although these provide a significantly
  simpler way of reading and presenting quantum computations, manual
  manipulation of such graphs is slow and error prone. We
  present a formalism that supports a mechanised reasoning about such
  graphs. This involves a compositional account of graph rewriting
  that preserves the underlying categorical semantics. We present a
  system, which has been implemented, with a fixed logical kernel and
  support for derived rules, which allows the model of quantum
  computation  to be specified declarativley.
  Soundness of the 
  system is proved with respect to the underlying model and
  completeness is an open problem.

\item simplification ordering
\item confluence arguments for graphs
\item formalise algorithms in a thm prover
\item richer graph structures - quantification over edges
\item richer expression language in vertices
\item completeness of rewrite rules with respect to wpHilb
\end{itemize}
