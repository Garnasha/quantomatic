\begin{abstract}
  Systems of quantum computation are typically represented by large
  matrix compositions. However, recent graph-based formalisms offer an
  approach which exposes the structure of these systems in a clearer
  and more accessible way. Although these provide a significantly
  simpler way of reading and presenting quantum computations, manual
  manipulation of such graphs is slow and error prone. We
  present a formalism that supports a mechanised reasoning about such
  graphs. This involves a compositional account of graph rewriting
  that preserves the underlying categorical semantics. We present a
  system, which has been implemented, with a fixed logical kernel and
  support for derived rules, which allows the model of quantum
  computation  to be specified declarativley.
  Soundness of the 
  system is proved with respect to the underlying model and
  completeness is an open problem.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Compact Closed Categories and Graphs}
\label{sec:mono-categ-graphs}

representation of freely generated compact closed  categories  as
graphs;

theorem: two arrows in a a freely generated compact closed  category
are equal iff and only if their graphs are equal.

Note that the notion of vertex and graph have the same external
structure so it is possible to view a subgraph as a vertex and vice versa.

\section{Quotients and Rewriting}
\label{sec:quotients-rewriting}

Unfortunately. or fortunately, few examples of interesting
compact closed categories are freely generated.  In practice we work
with cateories presented as generators and \emph{equations}.  For
representing quantum computations, Coecke and Duncan
\cite{Coecke:2008jo} propose the following collection of generators:
\begin{description}
\item[Objects] the self dual object $Q$;
\item[Arrows] $\epsilon_Z : Q \to I$, $\delta_Z : Q \to Q \otimes Q$,
  $\alpha_Z : Q \to Q$, $\epsilon_X : Q \to I$, $\delta_X : Q \to Q \otimes Q$,
  $\alpha_X : Q \to Q$ and $H:Q\to Q$.
\end{description}
subject to  the following equations:
\begin{gather}
  (\delta \otimes \id{Q}) \circ \delta 
   =   ( \id{Q} \otimes \delta) \circ \delta  
  \tag{A}\label{comonoid-assoc}
  \\
  (\epsilon \otimes \id{Q}) \circ \delta 
  = (\id{Q} \otimes \epsilon)\circ \delta 
  = \id{Q} \tag{U} \label{comonoid-unit}
  \\
  \delta = \sigma \circ \delta \tag{C}\label{comonoid-comm}
  \\
  \delta^\dag \circ \delta = \id{Q} \tag{I}\label{isometry}
  \\
  (\delta^\dag \otimes \id{Q}) \circ (\id{Q}\otimes \delta)
  = \delta \circ \delta^\dag \tag{F}\label{frobenius}
\end{gather}

its denotation is the
  2-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^2$

\section{Graph Patterns}
\label{sec:patterns}

The representation of Compact Closed Categories as Graphs, discuseed
in the previous section, is too restrictive for automated reasoning
about quantum computation. In particular, pictures such as the
following are frequently needed:

\begin{center}
  \scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics{images/spider_lhs.eps}}
\end{center}

\noindent Such pictures represent an infinite family of concrete
graphs. In this section we describe an extension of the representation
for Compact Closed Categories that allows a graph-based representation
that captures an infinite family of graphs. Notably, this allows us to
represent laws about quantum computation, such as
Spider-Law~\ref{spider-law-fig}. Furthermore, this representation is
still compositional in the sense that we can compose graphs. The
extension, which we call \ref{graph patterns}, adds two extra kinds of
nodes to the graph. Namely, {\em banged boxes} which informally
represent an arbitrary number of copies of a node (where the node is
defined as some graph), and {\em variable nodes} which informally
represent some, as yet unkown, node in a graph.

\subsection{Variable Nodes}

In graph patterns, variable nodes generalise the concept of a
half-edge. A graph with variable nodes is given the following
interpretation in the underyling semantics of our concrete graphs:

Definition: super-type: given a node with type T

instantiation of a variable node: 

\begin{itemize}
\item let the set of node kinds be denoted $K$
\item given a graph $G$, containing a variable node $x$, where for a
  given non-vaiable node $n$ it's type is written $T_n$, the concrete
  graph is:

$$
\{G[x/]  | x \in V \}
$$

\item 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compositonality}

By enriching graphs with variable-nodes and banged-boxes, to form
graph-patterns, we have lost the compositionality principle from the
underlying concrete graphs. However, this can be restored and shown to
correspond to the underyling compositionality principle. 

Type Expressions: We introduce a new form of type for a pattern
graph. In particular,

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

Initially one might be tempted to think that the usual notion of
subgraph might surfice for expressing matching, however it allows
additional edges on nodes where, because of the tensorial semantics of
our graphs, we do not. Our work provides a restriction of the usual
subgraph definition that is sound for Compact Closed Categories.

Link Graphs and their extention to BiGraphs also encapsualte a very
different kind of semantics where they allow edges to go to multiple
nodes. An interesting area of further work would be to consider our
graph patterns for these, and other, graph based formalisms.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Ideas for further work
\begin{itemize}
\item simplification ordering
\item confluence arguments for graphs
\item formalise algorithms in a thm prover
\item richer graph structures - quantification over edges
\item richer expression language in vertices
\item completeness of rewrite rules with respect to wpHilb
\end{itemize}
