update install docs: 

 - clarify need for POLYLIB in env
   (I think LD_LIBRARY_PATH is what is actually required, although
    on Linux even that shouldn't be required as the path should be
    embedded in the executable - AHM)
 - clarify other needed tools: e.g. dot

1. Java Layout (done-ish)
2. Customisable vertex/edge data (sort-of)
3. Matching respects edge direction
4. Finish theory editor   
   -> "proof view"
5. Remove symmetries in matching (doesn't work with !-boxes)
6. More general semantics (e.g. relational)
7. Gui support for plugging
8. Plugging lots of points (model check - eval on basis)
9. improve mathematica support
10. auto-confluence analysis (requires graph unification)
11. better diagrams into TeX
12. Tool palettes / Generic UI polish / scroll bars / refactor
front-end
13. Faster rendering (text controls) (I think this is OK now)
14. Rethinks views
15. Enforce Types for vertices
16. different graph types: planar; progressive; etc.
